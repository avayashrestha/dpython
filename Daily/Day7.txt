🔐 Day 7: Lists, Loops & Wordlists
🎯 Why It Matters:
In hacking, you often:

Scan lists of IPs

Try multiple passwords

Loop through usernames, ports, services...

So today, you're learning how to:

Create a list

Loop through it

Check for matches (like a wordlist attack)


🧠 PART 1: Lists
A list is like a bag of items.
python
tools = ["nmap", "wireshark", "hydra", "burpsuite"]
print(tools[0])  # Outputs: nmap


🔁 PART 2: Loop Through a List
python
for tool in tools:
    print(f"Using {tool} for recon...")
This is how brute force works — one item at a time.



🔎 PART 3: Check if Item Exists
python
passwords = ["admin", "123456", "letmein"]
if "123456" in passwords:
    print("Weak password detected!")
