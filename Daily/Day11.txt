🎯 Day 11: Reading Files Like a Spy
🕵️ Agent Avaya, you're now stepping into the realm of data extraction — reading from files to gather intel. In real-world hacking, this is how wordlists, config files, and scan logs are used.

🧠 What You’ll Learn Today:
How to read files

Loop through each line

Filter or search for targets

Display results like a pro



🔍 PART 1: Read a File
python
with open("target.txt", "r") as file:
    data = file.read()
    print(data)
🧠 This opens the file and prints everything in it.



🔁 PART 2: Loop Through Lines
python
with open("target.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print("Found:", line.strip())
🔐 line.strip() removes newlines for clean output.



🔎 PART 3: Search for a Target
python
target_ip = "192.168.0.1"
with open("target.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        if target_ip in line:
            print(f"✅ Found target IP: {target_ip}")
            break
    else:
        print("❌ Target IP not found.")


🚀 Bonus: Read & Count Targets
python
with open("target.txt", "r") as file:
    targets = file.readlines()
    print(f"Total targets found: {len(targets)}")
