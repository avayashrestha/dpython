🎯 Day 12: File Writing, IP Filtering & Threat Logging
Welcome back, Agent Avaya. Today’s mission: detect, log, and escalate threats found in your target list. 💻🔎



💾 PART 1: Writing to Files
Let’s say you want to store any suspicious IPs in a file called threats.txt.

python
with open("threats.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Suspicious IP found: 8.8.8.8\n")
This appends a line to the file instead of overwriting it.



🔍 PART 2: IP Pattern Detection
You can look for specific patterns in IPs. For example:

python
if ip.startswith("192."):
    print("🔐 Private network IP detected!")



Or detect known suspicious IPs:

python
blacklist = ["8.8.8.8", "1.1.1.1"]
if ip in blacklist:
    print("⚠️ Blacklisted IP detected!")
🗃 PART 3: Full Workflow (What You’ll Do Today)
Your Day 12 Mission will involve:

Reading from a file (target.txt)

Scanning each IP

Checking if it’s private or blacklisted

Logging suspicious ones into threats.txt
