🧠 What You’ll Learn
for and while loops

Looping through lists

Building a password brute-forcer

🔁 1. FOR Loop
Used when looping over a list or range:

python
passwords = ["1234", "admin", "letmein"]

for pwd in passwords:
    print("Trying password:", pwd)



🔁 2. WHILE Loop
# Used when you want to repeat until a condition is met:

python
attempts = 0
while attempts < 5:
    print("Hacking attempt:", attempts)
    attempts += 1
🛠️ Mini Project: Password Cracker Simulator
python
Copy code
# Simulated correct password (in real life, this would be unknown)
correct_password = "toor"

# List of common passwords
wordlist = ["1234", "admin", "root", "toor", "letmein"]

# Brute force loop
for pwd in wordlist:
    print(f"Trying password: {pwd}")
    if pwd == correct_password:
        print("💥 Password cracked! ->", pwd)
        break
else:
    print("❌ Password not found in wordlist.")
🔍 Explanation:
for pwd in wordlist: goes through each password

If it matches, break ends the loop

The else under the loop runs if no match was found



⚠️ Hacking Tip:
In real ethical hacking, you'd use tools like Hydra, Medusa, or Python’s requests module to brute force login forms, FTP, SSH, etc.
But this kind of logic is the core behind those tools.



🔥 Bonus Challenge:
Make the correct_password a user input (simulate target login)

Ask the user to enter their own wordlist

Track how many attempts were made
