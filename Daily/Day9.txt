🧠 PART 1: Username List
A list of usernames is called a userlist — it’s used just like a password wordlist.

python
usernames = ["admin", "user", "guest", "root"]



🔁 PART 2: Brute Force Loop
You can combine usernames and passwords using nested loops to test all combinations:

python
for user in usernames:
    for pwd in passwords:
        print(f"Trying {user}:{pwd}")
🔐 This simulates a real brute force attack — it tries every username with every password.



✅ PART 3: Check for a Match
You can simulate a login system like this:

python
correct_user = "admin"
correct_pass = "letmein"

for user in usernames:
    for pwd in passwords:
        if user == correct_user and pwd == correct_pass:
            print(f"Access Granted for {user}")
            break



💥 BONUS: You can ask the user to input the correct username and password and simulate the brute force trying to "guess" it.
