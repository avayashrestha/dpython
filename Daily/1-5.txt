🧠 Day 1: Python Basics – Input & Output
This was your first step into programming.

You learned how to:

Use input() to get information from the user (like a name, tool, age).

Use print() to display messages back to the user.

Use f-strings to insert variables inside text (like: "Hello, {name}")

Use int() to convert strings into numbers.

Use if to check conditions (like if the user is 18 or older).

Use Case in Hacking: Building menus, getting target data, creating tools with user interaction.

🔐 Day 2: Dictionaries + Recon Tool
We leveled up by organizing data.

You learned:

What a dictionary is: a structure that stores key-value pairs like {"ip": "127.0.0.1"}.

How to ask for multiple inputs (IP, domain, port, OS, status, etc.).

How to store and print all of that data in a clean, readable format.

Use Case in Hacking: Storing scanned info, targets, port data, login attempts, vulnerabilities.

💣 Day 3: If / Elif / Else + Logic
Here you learned how a program can make decisions based on values.

You now understand:

if checks if a condition is true.

elif (else if) checks another condition if the first one fails.

else runs if nothing else matches.

You also learned comparison operators like ==, !=, >, <.

And logical operators like and, or, not.

Use Case in Hacking: Decision making like "is this port open?" or "is the password correct?"

🔁 Day 4: Loops + Brute Force Simulation
This was your intro to automation.

You mastered:

for loops to go through lists one by one (like trying multiple passwords).

while loops to repeat actions until a condition is false.

Tracking how many times something happens with a counter.

You even made your first brute-force password cracker simulation!

Use Case in Hacking: Repeating tasks like login attempts, scanning ports, or looping through payloads.

⚙️ Day 5: Functions + Modular Tools (Intro)
You’re now ready to build tools that are organized and reusable.

Concepts:

A function is a block of code you can run anytime, by calling its name.

You can pass info into a function using parameters.

Functions make your code cleaner, shorter, and more flexible.

For example, you might create:

A scan_port() function

A check_password() function

A get_target_info() function

Use Case in Hacking: Building scripts that do multiple tasks — like information gathering, scanning, brute force — in clean, reusable pieces.

🧭 So What Can You Do Now?
