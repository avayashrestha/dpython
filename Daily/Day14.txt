🧠 Today's Intel: Why Save Outputs?
In real hacking missions, you don’t just print results — you store them for analysis, automation, or reporting.

Today you’ll learn how to:

Loop through subdomains

Simulate which ones are “active”

Save only active ones into a file




🔧 Concept You’ll Use Today:
python


with open("found.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("data")
with open(...) is the safest way to handle files. It auto-closes when done.
