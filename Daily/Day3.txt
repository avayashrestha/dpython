🔍 Day 3: if / elif / else + Logic
✅ 1. if / else Basics
port = 22

if port == 22:
    print("Port 22 is for SSH.")
else:
    print("Not SSH.")


✅ 2. elif (else if)
port = 80

if port == 22:
    print("SSH")
elif port == 80:
    print("HTTP")
elif port == 443:
    print("HTTPS")
else:
    print("Unknown port")


✅ 3. Comparison Operators
Operator	Meaning	        Example
==	        Equal	        a == b
!=	        Not equal	    a != b
>	        Greater than	a > b
<	        Less than	    a < b
>=	        Greater or eq.	a >= b
<=	        Less or eq.	    a <= b


✅ 4. Logical Operators
# AND
if port == 22 and status == "open":
    print("SSH is open!")

# OR
if port == 22 or port == 23:
    print("Telnet or SSH")

# NOT
if not is_secure:
    print("This port is vulnerable!")



🛠️ Mini Project: Port Status Checker
port = int(input("Enter port number: "))
status = input("Is the port open or closed? ").lower()

if port == 22 and status == "open":
    print("SSH is open. Secure access possible.")
elif port == 21 and status == "open":
    print("FTP is open. Might be exploitable.")
elif port == 80 and status == "open":
    print("HTTP is open. Check for websites.")
else:
    print("Either the port is closed or uncommon.")
